# ðŸ”’SecureUSB

SecureUSB is a cross-platform Python app that provides secure authentication, encryption, and decryption for USB devices. It integrates USB detection, password-based authentication, AES-256-GCM encryption, and a user-friendly CLI for managing USB security.

ðŸš€ Features:
 1. USB Detection & Authentication
        Real-time USB insertion/removal detection on windows & macOS
        Password-based authentication with PBKDF2 key derivation
        Salted and hashed keys for secure verification
        Device metadata tracking with UUID
        Multi-device management

 2. Enterprise-Grade Security
        AES-256-GCM encryption for files and folders
        Batch encryption/decryption with progress visualization
        File integrity verification with SHA-256

 3. Progress Visualization
        Real-time progress bars with tqdm
        File-by-file operation feedback
        Detailed operation statistics
        Error reporting and recovery


ðŸ”§ How It Works
Encryption Process

USB Detection â†’ Automatically detects inserted USB drives
Authentication â†’ User enters password (min 8 characters)
Key Derivation â†’ PBKDF2 derives 256-bit key from password
Metadata Creation â†’ Generates UUID and stores device info
File Encryption â†’ Encrypts files using AES-256-GCM
Secure Deletion â†’ Original files are securely removed

Decryption Process

USB Detection â†’ Detects encrypted USB drive
Metadata Loading â†’ Reads device UUID and salt
Authentication â†’ Verifies password (3 attempts max)
Key Derivation â†’ Recreates encryption key from password
File Decryption â†’ Decrypts .enc files back to originals
Access Granted â†’ Files are accessible in plain form
 
ðŸš€ Quick & Easy
