- Document security architecture
- Regular security reviews and updates

## Performance Targets

### Encryption Performance
- **Small Files** (< 1MB): < 100ms encryption time
- **Medium Files** (1-100MB): < 5 seconds encryption time
- **Large Files** (> 100MB): > 20 MB/s encryption throughput

### Memory Usage
- **Base Application**: < 50MB RAM usage
- **Encryption Operations**: < 100MB additional RAM
- **Large File Processing**: Streaming with fixed memory footprint

### Startup Time
